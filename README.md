# Uber-Clone-TBPPP-Project
An advanced ride-hailing application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). This project replicates core features of Uber, including real-time ride booking, driver-rider matching, live location tracking, and payment integration.

# üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js and Google Maps API for location services. <br/>
Backend: Node.js with Express.js for building scalable REST APIs. <br/>
Database: MongoDB (Compass) for managing user, driver, and ride data. <br/>
Real-Time Updates: Socket.IO for real-time communication between users and drivers. <br/>
